Types of posts

Posts may or may not have post_hints based on the settings of the subreddit. If no post hint is available will need a way to
determine what kind of post is being shown.
Types of post hints:
  -link (Just a link to another page)
  -image (Just and image)
  -hosted:video (Reddit video)
  -rich:video (External video likely youtube)
  -self (Basically a text post)


If the post_hint is undefined then we will need to check each individual content type to figure out what kind of post it is


TODO:


Add an image gallery option for posts with multiple images 
parse image links in text comments and display them as an image istead of a link
find a way to display posts that have no post hint


Before going to prod: 

http cookies should be set to secure = true
